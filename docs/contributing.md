**Setup** <br>
To edit, install docsify-cli to preview the website pages locally using `npm i docsify-cli -g` (if you don't have npm, you can download it through [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)). Once installed, clone the [github repo](https://github.com/UAA-Robo/VEX-API). Then in the docs directory run `docsify serve` to preview the site locally in your browser.
