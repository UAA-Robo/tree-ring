**Setup.** 
To edit, install docsify-cli to preview the website pages locally using `npm i docsify-cli -g` (if you don't have npm, you can download it through [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)). Once installed, clone the [github repo](https://github.com/UAA-Robo/VEX-API). Then in that directory run `docsify serve` to preview the site locally in your browser.

<!-- **Formatting.**
To add classes or methods to this repo, please follow the cpp/template.md format.
* Please use **method and parameter** descriptions from the actual comments in the vexCode code (as viewed in VSCode with the VEX extension). Methods should be alphabetized. Use [this outdated documentation](https://help.vexcodingstudio.com/index.html) as a loose reference for formatting.

* Use **vex type descriptions** that are in the [VEXcode API](https://api.vexcode.cloud/v5/namespace/namespacevex). 

* Keep **examples** simple and make sure to test them. Each example should be a fully functioning block of code that can be run in main as is (that means include every variable declaration). Use comments if you add specific parameters. Don't use `using namespace vex` or `using namespace std`. Variables should be in snake case and should start with `my_` (ex/ `my_motor`) to help clarify the difference between our example variables and vex variables. -->
