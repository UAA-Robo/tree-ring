# Welcome to the Tree Grabber Nabber Documentation!
[This](https://uaa-robo.github.io/tree-ring/) is UAA Iceberg Robotics' documentation of the Tree Grabber Nabber.

**Setup.** 
To edit, install docsify-cli to preview the website pages locally using `npm i docsify-cli -g` (if you don't have npm, you can download it through [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)). Once installed, clone the [github repo](https://github.com/UAA-Robo/VEX-API). Then in that directory run `docsify serve` to preview the site locally in your browser.
