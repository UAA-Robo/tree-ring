# Instructions for Use

1. Open the Application. Optional: Select "Zero" and wait for the platform to zero.

    TODO add pic

2. Setup your tree ring sample on the tray, so it is at the left edge of the microscope camera. Make sure too focus the camera properly.

3. Input your sample length (default is 20cm), and the amount you would like shift the sample each time (default is 3mm).

4. Select "Start Automation". If you are on Windows, you will be prompted to select the folder in which you want the photos to be placed. (Mac will default to putting photos in a "tree_ring_captures" folder on the Desktop).

5. Let the script run. It will prompt you when finished. With all the time you save from this automation, use it to go cure cancer :D
